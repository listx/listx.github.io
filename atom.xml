<p>I’m still happily employed at Google.</p>
<h1 id="git-book">Git Book</h1>
<p>I’m still working on this project. It is hard because I’m trying to create real repositories and situations that the reader should be able to check out and follow along. Still, I should be able to finish this next year.</p>
<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
<p>I’ve started dabbling in Clojure, Rust, and Elixir. This list is not the same list of programming languages in my last post (which mentioned Shen, Rust, Erlang, Idris, and Factor), but it’s something to chew on for quite some time.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since my last blog post. Many things have happened since that time.</p>
<p>Below are some of the more interesting items.</p>
<h1 id="imvu-to-google">IMVU to Google</h1>
<p>I got laid off at <a href="https://imvu.com">IMVU</a> in September 2017. It was a difficult time for me as I had become good friends with the people there. After almost 2 months of searching for jobs, I somehow managed to land a job at Google! My title is Release Engineer. I’ve been there almost a year now and I am still happy and excited to work there.</p>
<h1 id="golang">Golang</h1>
<p>I started learning Golang a few months ago, because, I felt that this is the best time to learn it (while I’m employed by Google). I haven’t really done any of the advanced things yet, but I like how the language tries really hard to keep the syntax simple. It’s a lot like C in that regard.</p>
<p>The only pain point in Go for me is the packaging/installation system. The whole opintionated $GOPATH thing just feels a bit clunky because of the shared folder namespace with other projects. But I guess that’s unavoidable in any language’s ecosystem.</p>
<h1 id="git-book">Git Book</h1>
<p>I started writing a short (informal) book on Git. I am using LuaTeX to write it; I started in March 2018 but have yet to cross the 1/2 way mark. Hopefully I’ll get it done before March 2019 rolls around.</p>
<h1 id="haskell-book">Haskell book</h1>
<p>Back in <a href="./2016-01-04-status-update.html">2016’s status update</a> I said that I still planned to finish the Haskell book I was working on. That project is definitely dead. One reason is that due to the rising popularity of the language, I feel that other people have already said what I had meant to say in my book.</p>
<h1 id="shen-rust-erlang-idris-factor">Shen, Rust, Erlang, Idris, Factor</h1>
<p>I’ve grown interested in these languages because well, I feel like they are important. My hope is to find some interesting problems that can be solved idiomatically in each language. That might take years, but, it is my hope that in the future I’ll be able to write about these languages.</p>
<h1 id="https-for-this-site">HTTPS for this site</h1>
<p>Apparently HTTPS support for custom domains on Github have been a thing since earlier this year. I never got around to it but thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@goelanirudh/add-https-to-your-namecheap-domain-hosted-on-github-pages-d66fd96308b5">this post</a> I finally enabled it.</p>

    <title>The Math Behind the Tower of Hanoi Problem</title>
    <link href="http://funloop.org/post/2017-05-13-tower-of-hanoi.html" />

	<code class="date">2017-05-13</code><a class="history" href="https://github.com/listx/listx_blog/commits/master/post/2017-05-13-tower-of-hanoi.org" title="History">*</a>
	<br>
	<a href="/tag/math.html">math</a>
</div>

<p>In the very first chapter of the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics"><em>Concrete Mathematics</em> 2ed</a> there is a discussion about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a>. This post is a distillation of that discussion.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>There are 3 rods, with 8 discs (with holes) resting on one rod; the discs are sorted in size like a pyramid, with the smallest disc on top. We want to move all discs to another rod, but with the following rules: (1) a move consists of moving a single disc onto a rod; (2) you may never place a bigger disc on top of a smaller one. A question arises — <strong>how many steps are required to move the entire tower of disks onto another rod?</strong></p>
<h1 id="finding-the-recurrence">Finding the Recurrence</h1>
<p>First consider the simplest case, without any discs. Because there are no discs to move, we cannot make any moves, and so the number of steps required is 0. We can write this as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_0 = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> meaning the number of steps and the subscript representing the number of discs in the tower.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider how the problem scales. With 1 disc, the answer is a single step since the one disc is itself the entire tower. With 2 discs, the answer is three steps — one step to move the top (small) disc to another rod, one step to move the big disc to the destination rod, and lastly one step to move the small disc on top of the big disc. With 3 discs, the answer is seven steps — the insight here is that we treat the top two discs exactly the same as the previous problem; so we need 3 moves to move the top two to another rod, then one move to move the biggest disc to the destination rod, then again 3 moves to move the 2-disc sub-tower to the destination rod.</p>
<p>The example with 3 discs is quite telling. We can use the insights gained there to set an upper bound to the number of steps required for the general case of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> discs; if we take more steps than this upper bound, we would know that we made mistakes. For a tower of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we require <span class="math inline">\(S_{n - 1}\)</span> steps to move all discs except the biggest one, then move the biggest disc, then move the sub-tower on top of that disc with (again) <span class="math inline">\(S_{n - 1}\)</span> steps. So the upper bound is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation} \label{eq:recurrence}
  S_n =
  \begin{cases}
    0                   &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
    2 * (S_{n - 1}) + 1 &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>If that’s the upper bound, then is there a separate formula for the <em>lower bound</em> (optimal solution)? Nope! It’s because there must come a time in solving the puzzle where we move the biggest disc to the destination rod. To get to the biggest disc, we must have moved all discs on top of it to another rod (the sub-tower); and, after having moved the biggest disc, we must move this sub-tower back on top of that rod (back onto the biggest disc). Because of these constraints stemming the definition of the puzzle itself, we know that for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> &gt; 0 we must take <em>at least</em> <span class="math inline">\(2 * (S_{n - 1}) + 1\)</span> steps.</p>
<p>The upper and lower bounds agree in their formulation, and this formulation (Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span>) is our recurrence. In mathematics, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">recurrence relation</a> is basically a recursively-defined equation, where a <em>base case</em> in the recurrence defines the starting point. In Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span>, the base case is <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span>; for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 0\)</span>, we define the number of steps required in a recursive manner.</p>
<p>In our discussion of finding the upper and lower bounds, there were two key concepts — the need to move the biggest disc, and the need to move the sub-tower twice (before and after moving the biggest disc). Our recurrence clearly agrees with these two concepts. The “<span class="math inline">\(+ 1\)</span>” in the non-base case is the step of moving the biggest disc, whereas the <span class="math inline">\(2 * (S_{n - 1})\)</span> is the number of steps required to move the sub-tower <em>twice</em>.</p>
<h1 id="simplifying-the-recurrence">Simplifying the Recurrence</h1>
<p>Recurrences are great, but they are painful to compute. For example, it’s not immediately clear what <span class="math inline">\(S_{11}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(S_{54}\)</span> evaluates to. It would be really nice if we could avoid defining <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> recursively.</p>
<p>And this is where math meets science. In the scientific method, we have to come up with a hypothesis and then test that hypothesis with one or more experiments. We can do the same thing here by trying to guess the solution to the recurrence.</p>
<p>For one thing, we know that <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> grows as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> grows (it will never be the case that <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> somehow plateaus or decreases down the road). The more discs there are, the more work we have to do, right? So let’s look at small cases to see how the numbers grow, and see if there is a pattern to the growth rate of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span></th>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">8</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">255</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We don’t have to actually simulate the puzzle to derive these values; using the recurrence Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span> we start off from the first row (the base case) and then calculate our way down, reusing <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> from the previous row as <span class="math inline">\(S_{n - 1}\)</span>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyway, the values of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> sure look familiar — especially if we use base 2.</p>

<p>It looks like our recurrence simplifies to just</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation} \label{eq:solution}
  S_n = 2^n - 1 \quad \text{for } n \geq 0,
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>except it is no longer a recurrence as there is no need to define a base case. We’ll call it a <em>solution</em> to the recurrence.</p>
<h1 id="proving-the-solution">Proving the Solution</h1>
<p>Although the empirical evidence looks very good, we have not formally proved that the solution (Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:solution}\)</span>) holds for <em>all</em> <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. It’s one thing to say that something is true for all <em>observed</em> cases (scientific experiment), and quite another to say that something is true for <em>all</em> cases (mathematical proof).</p>
<p>Can we prove it? Yes! Fortunately for us, Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span> lends itself to proof by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">induction</a>. Induction requires you to first prove some number <span class="math inline">\(k_0\)</span> as a starting point (the base case) using some proposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Then you prove that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> holds for <span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span> (the next number); i.e., show that going from <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span> does not change <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. This is the <em>inductive step</em>. In this way, we prove the “totality” of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> as it applies to all numbers in the range <span class="math inline">\([k_0, k_{m}]\)</span> and we are done. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Here we want to prove that Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:solution}\)</span> holds for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (all natural numbers). <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For this proof let’s rewrite Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:solution}\)</span> to use <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation} \label{eq:proposition}
  S_k = 2^k - 1 \quad \text{for } k \geq 0.
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:proposition}\)</span> is our proposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. The base case is easy enough to prove: <span class="math inline">\(S_0 = 0\)</span> because there are no disks to move. For the inductive step, we use the non-base part of our recurrence from Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span> to get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align}
  S_k &amp;= 2 * (S_{k - 1}) + 1 \label{eq:induct1}
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and rewrite it in terms of <span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align}
  S_{k + 1} &amp;= 2 * (S_{k}) + 1. \label{eq:induct2}
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now the critical part: we replace <span class="math inline">\(S_k\)</span> with Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:proposition}\)</span> (our proposition), because we assume that our proposition is true for all steps up to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (but not <span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span>, which is what we’re trying to prove):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align}
  S_{k + 1} &amp;= 2 * (2^k - 1) + 1.
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>In case you forgot algebra, <span class="math inline">\(2 * 2^k = 2^1 * 2^k = 2^{k + 1}\)</span> and we can use this to simplify our equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align}
  S_{k + 1} &amp;= 2 * (2^k - 1) + 1\\
  &amp;= [2 * (2^k - 1)] + 1\\
  &amp;= [(2 * 2^k - 2)] + 1\\
  &amp;= (2^{k + 1} - 2) + 1\\
  &amp;= 2^{k + 1} - 1 \label{eq:induct3}.
  \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>And now we can see that Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:induct3}\)</span> (our “evolved” proposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, if you will) is the same as our solution (Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:solution}\)</span>), even though we increased <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span>! This is because simple substitution allows us to replace “<span class="math inline">\(k + 1\)</span>” with “<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>”. We have completed our proof by induction. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="alternate-recurrence-and-solution">Alternate Recurrence and Solution</h1>
<p>The book goes on to offer an alternate recurrence to Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence}\)</span>, by adding 1 to both sides:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
  (S_n) + 1 &amp;=
  \begin{cases}
    0 + 1                   &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
    2 * (S_{n - 1}) + 1 + 1 &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0 \\
  \end{cases}\\
          &amp;=
  \begin{cases}
    1                   &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
    2 * (S_{n - 1}) + 2 &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0. \label{eq:recurrence2}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This recurrence is the same as the original, except that it adds 1 to the answer. Now we let <span class="math inline">\(W_n = (S_n) + 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W_{n - 1} = (S_{n - 1}) + 1\)</span> and rewrite everything in terms of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
  W_n &amp;=
  \begin{cases}
    1                   &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
    2 * (W_{n - 1})     &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 0. \label{eq:recurrence3}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice how the “<span class="math inline">\( + 2\)</span>” in Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence2}\)</span> goes away, because the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:recurrence3}\)</span> will multiply with the “<span class="math inline">\( + 1\)</span>” from <span class="math inline">\(W_{n - 1}\)</span> to get it back. Using this alternate recurrence, it’s easy to see that the solution is just <span class="math inline">\(W_n = 2^n\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> can only grow by multiplying <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to itself! Hence</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
W_n = (S_n) + 1 = 2^n
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and subtracting 1 from all sides gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
(W_n) - 1 =S_n = 2^n - 1.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The lesson here is that if it is difficult to find the solution to a recurrence, we can use basic algebra rules to transform the recurrence to something more amenable. In this case, all it took was adding 1 to the original recurrence.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed figuring this stuff out because possibly for the first time in my life I used my programming experience (recurrence/recursion, memoization) to help myself understand mathematics — not the other way around. The other way around was never enjoyable — calculating what <code>i</code> was in some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th iteration of a <code>for</code>-loop never really excited me.</p>
<p>I hope this explanation helps you better understand the first few pages of <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>; I had to read that part three times over to really “get it” (never having learned what induction is). And henceforth, I will never look at a string of consecutive 1’s in binary the same way again. 😃</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\mathrm{F}_{0} = 0\\
\mathrm{F}_{1} = 1\\
\mathrm{F}_{n} = \mathrm{F}_{n - 2} + \mathrm{F}_{n - 1}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>That is, each Fibonacci number <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span> is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, except the very first two numbers which are defined to be 0 and 1. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>From the definition above, it appears that computing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span> requires one to always compute <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}\)</span>. <strong>This is false:</strong> enter the “doubling method”. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="the-genesis-of-the-doubling-method">The Genesis of the Doubling Method</h1>
<p>The doubling method uses a couple of mathematical formulas derived from matrix multiplication as it applies to calculating Fibonacci numbers; it can be seen as an improvement over the matrix multiplication method, although it does not use matrix multplication itself. The matrix multiplication method uses the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}^n
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n}\\
\mathrm{F}_{n} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>This result is quite interesting in its own right; to find <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span> you only need to raise the matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>to the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th power. To be more precise, this method is matrix <em>exponentiation</em>. The only downside is that much of the answer is wasted — we don’t care about <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}\)</span>, not to mention how <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span> is redundantly computed twice.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-in-terms-of-mathrmf_n">Thinking in Terms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span></h2>
<p>What if we could find <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span> not by multiplying or adding some numbers, but by multiplying and adding <em>other Fibonacci terms</em>? Of course, we’re not talking about adding <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}\)</span> because that would be too slow. Let’s have a look at the matrix identity again (reversed for easier reading):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n}\\
\mathrm{F}_{n} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}^n.
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we substitute in <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{F}_{2n + 1} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{2n}\\
\mathrm{F}_{2n} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{2n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}
&amp; =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}^{2n} \\
&amp; =
  \bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 1\\
  1 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}^{n}\bigg)^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and we can substitute in our matrix identity from above to rewrite this as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
&amp; =
  \bigg(\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathrm{F}_{n + 1} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n}\\
  \mathrm{F}_{n} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{n - 1}
  \end{bmatrix}\bigg)^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and carry out the squaring to get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
&amp; =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  {{\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}}^2 + {\mathrm{F}_{n}}^2} &amp; {{\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}\mathrm{F}_{n}} + {\mathrm{F}_{n}\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}}}\\
  {{\mathrm{F}_{n}\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}} + {\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}\mathrm{F}_{n}}} &amp; {{\mathrm{F}_{n}}^2 + {\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}}^2}
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The top right and bottom left terms are identical; we can also rewrite them to be a bit simpler.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
  {{\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}\mathrm{F}_{n}} + {\mathrm{F}_{n}\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}}}
&amp; =
  \mathrm{F}_{n}(\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} + \mathrm{F}_{n - 1}) \\
&amp; =
  \mathrm{F}_{n}[\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} + (\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n})] \\
&amp; =
  \mathrm{F}_{n}(2\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n}).
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This simplication achieves an important task — it obviates <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}\)</span> by cleverly defining it as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n}\)</span>. Putting everything together, whe have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{F}_{2n + 1} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{2n}\\
\mathrm{F}_{2n} &amp; \mathrm{F}_{2n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}
&amp; =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  {{\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}}^2 + {\mathrm{F}_{n}}^2} &amp; {\mathrm{F}_{n}(2\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n})}\\
  {\mathrm{F}_{n}(2\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n})} &amp; {{\mathrm{F}_{n}}^2 + {\mathrm{F}_{n - 1}}^2}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the first row (or column) gives us two very useful identities</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\mathrm{F}_{2n}
&amp; =
  {\mathrm{F}_{n}(2\mathrm{F}_{n + 1} - \mathrm{F}_{n})} \\
\mathrm{F}_{2n + 1}
&amp; =
  {{\mathrm{F}_{n}}^2 + {\mathrm{F}_{n + 1}}^2}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>As these identities form the heart of the doubling method, let’s call them the <em>doubling identities</em>.</p>
<p>And now we just need one more piece to formulate our doubling method; we need to borrow an idea from number theory. Given any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, it is the same as either <span class="math inline">\(2m\)</span> (even) or <span class="math inline">\(2m + 1\)</span> (odd), where <span class="math inline">\(m = \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\)</span>; for our purposes, let us call this property the “halving property”.</p>
<p>Whereas the doubling identities allow us to “double” our way into bigger numbers, the halving property allows us to halve our way down to smaller and smaller numbers. The marriage of these two concepts gives rise to the doubling method.</p>
<h1 id="the-doubling-method">The Doubling Method</h1>
<p>To compute the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th Fibonacci term we break <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> itself down into its halves (<span class="math inline">\(2m\)</span>) recursively, until we go down to <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span>. At this point we multiply our way back up using the doubling identities. Because halving and doubling by themselves always calculate <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{2m}\)</span>, we have to manually return <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{F}_{2m + 1}\)</span> if our current sequence index number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd.</p>

<p>Line 12 is where we do the halving. We use the right-shift operator to do this. Lines 13 and 14 are our doubling identities (I use the left-shift operator here because it feels more natural to me).

<p>For comparison, here is an iterative version. On the one hand it avoids Python’s recursion limit, but the downside is a small loss of elegance (we have to loop twice — first to build up the halving/doubling points, and again for the main loop).</p>

<p>I used <code>ghc</code> 8.0.1, and <code>gcc</code> 5.4.0. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Below are some things I tried, but could not get to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to delete the <code>gcd.c</code> file by moving the function definition in <code>gcd.c</code> to <code>gcd.h</code> (and delete <code>gcd.c</code> entirely). I compiled the object file with <code>gcc -c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o gcd.o gcd.h</code> but then I got this error:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code> $ ghc --make ffi.hs ../c/gcd.o

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In <code>GCD.hs</code> you can see the line <code>foreign import ccall &quot;gcd.h gcd&quot;﻿</code>. Instinctively I thought that the <code>gcd.h</code> in <code>﻿&quot;gcd.h gcd&quot;﻿</code> served as a kind of disambiguator, for where the <code>gcd()</code> function came from. So then I defined another function named <code>gcd()</code> in a different C header file (<code>gcd_other.h</code>), compiled it separately, but got a “multple definition” error:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code> $ ghc --make ffi.hs ../c/gcd.o ../c/gcd_other.o

<h1 id="newsflash">Newsflash!</h1>
<p>I just open-sourced my dotfiles! The repo is probably one of the older Git repos out there and has over 2000 commits! The <a href="https://github.com/listx/syscfg/commit/7ef106b306c1f2a5a7f622f67f1571976e8097ef">first commit</a> was made in March 10, 2009, over 7 years ago. Mind you, even by that time I had accumulated a whole suite of configs, and I even had an exotic setup with XMonad 0.8.1!</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways:</p>
<h2 id="maintain-clean-meaningful-commit-history">Maintain clean, meaningful commit history</h2>
<p>It’s nice to have clean commit history — every line of code can answer <strong>why</strong> it exists. You are doing yourself a disservice (in the long run) if you have overly terse commit messages. Generally speaking, be as verbose as you can be, but within reason. Keeping the first line of the commit message down to less than 80 characters goes a long way in setting the tone for any auxiliary paragraphs that follow.</p>
<p>I am quite proud of the richness of my commit messages. Pretty much everything makes sense and I don’t have to use Google to reason about my choices.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-build-system-simple">Keep your build system simple</h2>
<p>I’ve used a stupidly simple build system of creating symlinks to “install” my configuration — all with the help of a single <code>Makefile</code>. It’s not very flexible, and to be honest my Shell sklls are much better than what they used to be such that I could replace this setup with a script. But alas, the need for such a change has not been serious enough to warrant it.</p>
<p>Moreover, having a simple “build” system ensures robustness; the more I get older, the more I value systems that have a long “bit-rot halflife”. I admire Knuth’s TEX system for this very same reason. And this is the same reason why I will probably not use anything higher-level than a shell script for the job.</p>
<h2 id="delete-dead-code">Delete dead code</h2>
<p>Every long-living code repository ends up collecting clutter over the years. It’s important to delete such code (and of course any corresponding comments), to keep the codebase nimble. Ultimately, the less code you have to maintain, the better.</p>
<h2 id="dont-settle">Don’t settle</h2>
<p>Software evolves. Always be on the lookout for better software, and new ways to configure them! Leverage the power of open source (free upgrades!) and make it work for you.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-track-your-configs">Do you track your configs?</h1>
<p>If not, you should definitely consider it — what have you got to lose? Keeping a configuration repo (distributed across home computers) is probably the best way for you to learn how to use a distributed source control system; indeed it was how I learned to use Git properly.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<p>I’ve been using Vim (and now, Emacs with Evil mode) for years — and still, every once in a while I get a pleasant surprise. Today I learned that you can replay macros from Visual Line mode! So you don’t always have to record something like <code>j0</code> at the end of your macro to get down to the next line. I.e., after recording your macro for just 1 line, select other lines that you want to replay the macro against with Visual Line mode (<code>V</code>). To replay, do</p>
<pre><code>:&#39;&lt;,&#39;&gt;g/^/norm @q
</code></pre>
<p>(assuming that you recorded your macro into the <code>q</code> register with <code>qq...q</code>).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_mccord/status/530770735107547136">Chris McCord</a> for the tip (seek to about 3:20 in the <a href="https://youtu.be/3wAeFiGv_yE?t=3m20s">video</a>).</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>For years, whenever I wanted to interact with the outer shell environment from Latex, I would use one of two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>perform some shell step separately from Latex and inject it into the Latex sources, or</li>
<li>save it somewhere else and pull it in from Latex with <code>\input{foo}</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I learned recently that it can be done much more simply, if you are willing to use Luatex!</p>
<h1 id="enter-luatex">Enter Luatex</h1>
<p>Let’s assume that you keep your Latex document in source control and want to inject the Git hash into the document. First, define a new command called <code>\shell</code>.</p>
<pre><code>% Call shell! See http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/114939/30920.
\newcommand\shell[1]{\directlua{
    local handle, err = io.popen([[#1]])
    if not handle then
        tex.print(err)
        os.exit(1)
    end
    local result = handle:read(&quot;*a&quot;)
    handle:close()
    tex.print(result)
}}
</code></pre>
<p>Then use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\shell{TZ=&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39; date}

\shell{git describe --always}%
\shell{(( $(git --no-pager diff 2&gt;/dev/null | wc -l) + $(git --no-pager diff --cached 2&gt;/dev/null | wc -l) &gt; 0 )) &amp;&amp; echo &#39;*&#39;}
</code></pre>
<p>. I then use <code>lualatex --shell-escape foo.tex</code> to compile it. This is actual code from a Luatex document of mine.</p>
<p>I am not sure which shell program gets invoked, but for most things it should not matter much.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Now you know how to shell out from Latex!</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<h1 id="the-zq-keyoard-layout">The ZQ Keyoard Layout</h1>
<p>I’ve spent quite some time on keyboards in my previous posts, and this post is no different. After several months of tweaking my <a href="./2016-04-14-esrille-nisse-keyboard.html">original layout</a>, I have more or less settled on the final design. You can get the sources at my repo <a href="https://github.com/listx/new-keyboard">here</a>.</p>
<p>Is for the name “ZQ”, it was originally chosen from the way these keys were arranged; the location of these keys have since changed, but the name has stuck.</p>

<h2 id="keycap-arrangement">Keycap Arrangement</h2>
<p>I have not covered this topic before, but I think it is worth mentioning. On the underside of each keycap, there is a number; presumably for the row that the keycap is designed for. I’ve rearranged the default keycap placement to better reflect how I use my keys. The biggest change from the default Esrille setup is that I vertically flip the thumb row keys, so that they are “upside-down”. I find this arrangement more comfortable for my thumbs.</p>

<h1 id="typing-speed">Typing Speed</h1>
<p>After some time, I realized that the end goal was to design a layout that was not more “optimal” in the sense of mechanical efficiency, but rather to design something more <em>comfortable</em> to use. I can readily say that even at this early stage, I tend to like this layout more over Qwerty because my hands stay put as I type. The only time I move my wrists from their default position is when I need to reach the six keys up top in the base layer (<code>!#*/~$</code>).</p>
<p>It may turn out that this new layout does not really improve raw typing speed; but really I don’t care because home-row access to parentheses and the backspace key are too good to let go.</p>
<h1 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h1>
<p>The design has changed quite a bit in these past few months. After some initial trials, I realized that the arrangement recommended by my <a href="https://github.com/listx/keylo">program</a> was not really optimized the way I wanted it to be. For one, the corpus I fed into the program was not very good because it didn’t realy reflect my real-world use-case; I use Vim-style HJKL keys almost everywhere, and really to get a truly representative histogram of keypresses, I should have used a keylogger for some months to record my actual usage. As time was of the essence, I decided to just evolve the layout gradually, tweaking bits I found annoying.</p>
<p>One hurdle was simply trying to avoid using the same finger in succession. In the current ZQ layout, the right index finger is charged with six keys: MHBFJD. It took a lot of trial and error to arrive at this combination.</p>
<p>I also just kept the original Qwerty placement of the HJKL keys. The main reason is that I use these keys all the time, so much that they deserve their original home-row placement. And, actually they helped in reducing same-finger consecutiveness (J and K are rare letters in English).</p>
<p>Another point of concern was the interaction of some key combinations like YN and &lt;Return&gt;. It is common to type either Y or N and press &lt;Return&gt; immediately after, when dealing with interactive torminal programs. The same goes for some UNIX-y combinations like <code>~/</code> for the home directory in the filesystem, or <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> for interactive search in vim(1) and less(1), respectvely. The current design of ZQ strives to make these combinations easy to type.</p>
<p>Lastly, I paid a great deal of attention for certain common letter combinations — in particular, “gh”, “ch”, “sh”, “th”, and “wh”. Because I decided to keep HJKL keys on the home row, and because H was assigned to the right index finger, I had to make sure that I place the GCSTW keys either on the left side of the keyboard (as I did with “W”), or place them for the other fingers. This effort alone resulted in dictating where most of the keys ended up.</p>
<p>After all that’s been said, time will tell if I truly do end up using this layout. I have a friend who uses Dvorak for work and Qwerty for gaming; perhaps I’ll end up in a similar boat.</p>
