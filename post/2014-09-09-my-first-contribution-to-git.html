<p>I am happy to say that my <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/1407002817-29221-1-git-send-email-linusarver@gmail.com/">first series</a> was
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/4645b014c5c82a3b75337">recently merged</a> into the master Git branch! Now, I am by no means a C or Git
expert, so the patches only dealt with changes to the documentation. I
did not know anyone involved with Git in real life; nor did I have any
experience submitting patches to a big project like Git. So, how did I
do it?</p>
<h1 id="dead-simple-fix">Dead Simple Fix</h1>
<p>It all started when I typed in <code class="verbatim">man git init</code> and found this line:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>The template directory used will (in order):
</code></pre>
<p>. Obviously, there was a missing word “be” in that sentence. I could not
believe that such a glaring error was present in such a high profile
project like Git. Then again, if you think about it, you only invoke
<code class="verbatim">git init</code> once per project (to initialize a Git repository), so the
vast majority of users have but a cursory glance at the manpage — that
is, if they even bother at all to consult the manpages for such a basic
task.</p>
<p>Anyway, my initial reaction was “Aha! I will fix this typo and submit my
first patch to Git!”. I thought fixing something so simple and obvious
would surely have no trouble getting into the main branch. But then,
something stirred inside me, and compelled me to look for similar errors
in the manpage. Judging by the pace of things, my next patch to Git
might take one, two, five years (or forever?), and the thought of
becoming a one-shot, one-commit, one-word-fix contributor made my ego
twitch. And besides, it felt a bit stupid to just submit a two-letter
(“b” and “e”) fix. I thought to myself, “Maybe there are other
low-hanging fruits to pluck?”</p>
<h1 id="real-work">Real Work</h1>
<p>So, I set a medium-term goal to myself: read the entire <code class="verbatim">git init</code>
manpage, with a singular focus on clarity. I spotted more typographical
errors, and even some confusing parts that a Git newbie would have
trouble with. <code class="verbatim">git init</code>, after all, is a very basic, fundamental
operation that all newcomers to Git would probably have questions about.
It might even be the first thing that newbies might look up in the docs!</p>
<p>First things first. I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/git/git">master Git repository</a> from GitHub. I then created a new branch to record my
work; in the end, I created 7 commits. I read Git’s documentation on how
to submit patches, and also consulted contribution advice for the Linux
Kernel project in the form of <a href="http://youtu.be/LLBrBBImJt4">Greg Kroah-Hartman’s excellent talk</a>. The Linux Kernel is where Git’s real
action is (tens of thousands of contributors, all using Git!), so it
made sense to check out the Kernel’s way of doing things.</p>
<p>I used <code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code> countless times until I got everything sorted
out. I even reordered the commits to have the
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/6e1ccacbedf084971f095816f4450c4b607607c5">most basic one</a> (all typographical changes) be the first one, in case they
wanted to merge just a few of them and reject the rest.</p>
<p>After re-reading everything for the eighth time, I sent an email to the
official mailing list with <code class="verbatim">git send-email</code>. I checked <code class="verbatim">git blame</code> for
the lines I touched to CC everyone that could be directly affected by my
changes. After a few days, I got a response back — from the principal
maintainer of Git, Junio Hamano, no less!</p>
<h1 id="the-response">The Response?</h1>
<p>He was very polite, and true to his duty as maintainer, very thorough.
You can see the discussion that took place over at the
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/1407002817-29221-1-git-send-email-linusarver@gmail.com/">mailing list archive</a>. I sent off my second version of my 7-commit patch series
after a few days, and waited.</p>
<p>And waited. I waited two weeks, but alas, my new patch series was not
getting any further feedback. I was concerned that my changes were
simply forgotten. A nagging thought annoyed me — “What if I miss the
current merge window<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>?” In mild desperation, I sent an email
directly to Junio to remind him about my patches. Still no response. A
couple more weeks passed, and I almost forgot about my patches…</p>
<p>Until today! I got an email from <code class="verbatim">tip4commit.com</code> telling me that I was
given some miniscule fraction of a bitcoin for my contribution to the
Git project. It felt like some strange sort of scam, but even if it was,
whoever wrote that automated emailing script did their homework on the
Github API because lo and behold, my patches were indeed merged into the
mainline!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Well, as they say, if you don’t know how to code but still want to
contribute to an open source project, you should work on the
documentation! I assume that I did not get any feedback after the
initial code review because the maintainer, Junio, was busy with other
matters. If I think about it now, he does get tons of patches and needs
to do countless merges, containing countless commits, to make a new
release of Git.</p>
<p>So, when contributing to open source, try working on the documentation
first. Improving the documentation not only benefits all newcomers to
the project, but also helps you understand the project better — a win
win! And, be patient with your patches — especially if the project you
are contributing to has a busy schedule.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
