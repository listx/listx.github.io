<p>I’ll first describe 3 different levels of Git proficiency. Then I’ll discuss
ways to actually use Git “The Right Way” to get the most value out of it, and
end with some tips. Hopefully by the end of this post you’ll want to become an
advanced Git user if you’re not one already.</p>
<h1 id="beginner">Beginner</h1>
<p>You use Git as a necessary evil, because it’s mandated by your company to use
it. It’s the only way for you to contribute code, so you put up with it.</p>
<p>You use <code class="verbatim">git commit .</code> to commit everything in the (top-level?) directory, because
you don’t know how to use <code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code> effectively.</p>
<h1 id="intermediate">Intermediate</h1>
<p>You realize that Git is a useful tool for organizing code changes. You have
multiple branches and know how to keep each one up-to-date. You might also know
how to use <code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code> to clean up history, for example to separate out
formatting changes from semantic changes.</p>
<p>You use <code class="verbatim">git add -p</code> to help avoid needing to reach for <code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code>.</p>
<h1 id="advanced">Advanced</h1>
<p>You appreciate Git commit messages as an important tool for archiving historical
context and knowledge about every code change. These commit messages are written
in stone forever, so you take care to craft each one with the utmost care. You
care about giving a good reason (the <em>why</em>) in each commit message. And sometimes
there are multiple “why” reasons: why you are authoring the commit at all in the
first place, as well as why you are choosing the particular approach in the code.</p>
<p>This makes it pleasant for others to review your code, because you’ve taken the
time to explain everything in each commit, perhaps even preemptively answering
questions that code reviewers might have.</p>
<p>You try your best to help others understand the benefit of clean, beautiful Git
history, because you know that future maintainers of the codebase will
appreciate the story behind how it evolved over time.</p>
<h1 id="using-git-the-right-way-as-an-advanced-user">Using Git “The Right Way” as an Advanced User</h1>
<p>But what does it mean to use Git as an advanced user? How do commits
actually get created in an advanced way? This is what that looks like in
practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have to make each commit do exactly one thing, and also explain why you
did it that way (esp. if there are several alternative paths you rejected).</p></li>
<li><p>You have to order each commit so that it makes sense from the reviewer’s point
of view as they review each commit one at a time (for example, you don’t want
to have a pure formatting (whitespace) commit right in the middle of your
5-commit PR).</p></li>
<li><p>When you get PR comments, you have to go back to each commit and modify each
one accordingly. That is, you mustn’t add a trailing “address PR comments”
commit at the end which does 5 different things in one commit. That’s because
there is little value in preserving the original approach (with all its warts)
if they’re going to be deprecated within the same PR by an “address PR
comments” commit at the end. And such commits are by definition poorly crafted
because they often do 2, 3, or 5 things at once in a single commit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last point may be the dealbreaker for most Git users, because it requires
<code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code> familiarity. However there are at least two fantastic benefits
that you get from a codebase where Git was used in “The Right Way”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Code review becomes much more effective</strong>, because reviewers only have to focus
on one (neatly-explained and crafted) commit at a time. The signal-to-noise
ratio of each commit is high, so reviewers can spend more of their brainpower
actually thinking about the code, instead of fighting an uphill battle against
poorly organized commits that do several things at once (perhaps even wasting
time commenting on commit 1, only to see in commit 2 that a large chunk of
commit 1 has already been deprecated).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using <code class="verbatim">git-blame</code> becomes less noisy</strong>, because you’re not led back to messy
commits. This matters even more when the original authors of the codebase are
gone, because the value of a Git repo is that it can tell you a story of how
code changed over time. The value of this story is directly correlated with
the quality of the commit history. Woe to the developer who is led by
<code class="verbatim">git-blame</code> to a mega-commit (perhaps squashed together automatically by
GitHub), which squashes together 20 commits all together into a single
2000-line diff.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit to code review alone should be reason enough for you to get better
at using Git if you’re not comfortable with it already.</p>
<h1 id="tips-for-getting-better-at-git">Tips for getting better at Git</h1>
<h2 id="most-useful-git-commands">Most useful Git commands</h2>
<p>If I had to recommend 2 commands (which are most often neglected), it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="verbatim">git add -p</code> to add only those pieces that belong logically together, and</p></li>
<li><p><code class="verbatim">git rebase -i</code> to modify history for both preparing a PR for review, as well as
addressing review comments on a commit-by-commit basis (and not overall PR
basis as mentioned above with “address PR comments”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These two commands help you craft small, short-and-sweet commits that do one
thing well. It makes code review a breeze because the reviewer only has to look
at each of these small commits, one at a time.</p>
<h2 id="dont-create-meaningless-merges">Don’t create meaningless merges</h2>
<p>Another thing you can do is to avoid merging in the latest <code class="verbatim">main</code> (or <code class="verbatim">master</code>)
branch into your PR branch. GitHub shockingly encourages this horrible behavior,
encouraging newcomers to create many useless merge commits in a PR before it is
merged, making a real mess of the history.</p>
<p>Never merge <code class="verbatim">main</code> into your branch. Instead, every PR should have only 1 merge
commit — when the PR is merged into <code class="verbatim">main</code>. This keeps the history clean.</p>
<h2 id="rich-commit-messages">Rich commit messages</h2>
<p>Lastly, I recommend using the <strong>active voice</strong> in <strong>present tense (imperative mood)</strong> to
keep commit messages as <strong>direct</strong> as possible. Here’s an example of a noisy commit
message not adhering to these rules:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>fixed string buffer to have dynamically allocated memory instead of statically allocated limit of 255 characters sometimes we might need more than this esp on production
</code></pre>
<p>Terrible, right? Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There’s no commit message. It’s just the commit title.</p></li>
<li><p>The commit title is a long string (far over the recommended 50-character
limit) that will get truncated by GitHub on some of its UIs, not to mention
other Git tooling.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no use of punctuation like this sentence which makes it a run-on
sentence that makes it hard to read because punctuation was designed to help
break up long series of words into smaller chunks of logical groupings do you
really like to read long sentences without any punctuation I don’t think so
but if you do then I don’t know what to say about that.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s messy. There are several ideas here (string buffers, memory allocation,
hardcoded limits, and real-world production use-cases), but they aren’t really
given any attention individually. Instead they’re all jumbled up together into
one big mess.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, there are all of these <em>speed bumps</em> that just get in your way. It has
a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Well, at least it’s better than “fix string
bug” or some other lazy gibberish.</p>
<p>Now consider how the same commit message could have been written:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>module foo: use dynamic strings to avoid truncation

The use of the 255-character limit for strings in module foo was first
introduced in 0a6f593 (use fixed sizes for strings, 2022-03-14). This
worked for a long time because we always knew (at program init time)
what each string looked like.

But then 51b475c (allow changing strings during runtime, 2024-06-29)
introduced the ability for strings to be reassigned during runtime, not
just at program initialization. This means that sometimes users were
assigning strings longer than 255 characters without realizing that this
was the case, because we don't perform input validation during string
reassignments. This led to these strings getting silently truncated,
leading to a jarring experience later on.

Drop the 255-character limit, and instead use dynamic strings. We could
probably get away with a larger 1024-character limit, but then given how
most strings are far less than 1024 characters, using a larger hardcoded
limit would lead to a large amount of memory being wasted in practice.
If we do need to go back to a larger hardcoded limit in the future, we
could consider moving toward a model of multiple hardcoded limits,
perhaps 255, 512, and 1024. For now, using dynamic allocation everywhere
is simpler, so that's what we do here.
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s why it’s better:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It had a clear title. It even has a “module foo” prefix to signal that it’s
about the “foo” module.</p></li>
<li><p>It shares some historical knowledge (which is already present in Git but
perhaps not obvious to those not familiar with “module foo”) to explain the
problem, its origins, and current status quo. It references important
historical events with the associated commit messages, using <code class="verbatim">git show
 --no-patch --pretty=reference</code> output. The historical tour of these important
commits provides a huge amount of value behind the motivation of this commit.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses imperative mood “Drop the 255-character limit, and instead use dynamic
strings” to emphasize (and summarize) what’s actually changing in this commit.
So now when reviewers read this commit, they already know what to look for
(did the committer actually remove all fixed string limits?). This <em>empowers</em>
reviewers, because now they know what to expect.</p></li>
<li><p>It explains how the problem was happening, with “This means that sometimes
users were assigning strings longer than 255 characters without realizing that
this was the case, because we don’t perform input validation during string
reassignments.” A good reviewer may ask “why not just add input validation as
an alternative solution, instead of using dynamic allocation, to fix the
problem?” during code review. A commit message isn’t good because it’s some
bulletproof case for doing something a particular way — it also exposes
(perhaps unintentionally) any possible weaknesses with the chosen approach by
providing sufficient context into the problem space.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses well-formed sentences! With punctuation!</p></li>
<li><p>It has no typos and observes the “~50 char title, 72 char commit message”
rule. The 72 characters for commit messages could be relaxed to 80 or 100, but
you don’t want it too long because shorter columns are simply easier to read
when scanning the text with your eyes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it is longer. And it took more effort to write. I’m arguing that such
effort is worth it for future maintainers (maybe it’ll be the same person who
authored the commit 6 months later who has forgotten everything about “module
foo”).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Hopefully I’ve convinced you that using Git is much more nuanced than simply
knowing the right commands. If you want to get exposure to a project that
follows the above recommendations (full of advanced Git users), I recommend the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/community">Git project itself</a>.</p>
<p>Please use Git to its full potential. Don’t settle!</p>
