<p>I got a pair of the famous AKG K702 (manufacturer refurbished for $210)
fullsize headphones, and well, here’s my review. Previously, I was using
the Nuforce NE600M (purchased new December 2012 for $30) earbuds.
Comparing these two is unfair, because they are not really designed to
compete with each other; however, I must say that I was shocked by how
much better the K702s sounded. As a side note, I only use these
headphones for my laptop/PC, and I always use the Total Bithead
headphone amp/DAC.</p>
<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>
<ul>
<li>Made in Austria.</li>
<li>The K702s have a very large <em>soundstage</em>. This is probably because of
the open back design — the earcups have holes and allow some of the
sound to leak out. I listen to a lot of classical music and this makes
piano sonatas sound absolutely divine.</li>
<li>The highs and mids are very sharp and well-defined, allowing for good
sound separation (I can hear different instruments much more easily in
the same song).</li>
<li>The headphone cable is detachable.</li>
<li>The big earpads are comfortable, and also detachable for cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>
<ul>
<li>The headband feels a little tight, and I can feel it pressing down on
my head a little too much. Also, there is a clear plastic headband
part on each side to secure the leather headband, but this component
feels cheap and is prone to breakage down the line.</li>
<li>It’s not really a con, but the impedance is 62 ohms, which means you
will need a dedicated headhpone amp/DAC (unless you want to turn the
volume way up to get these headphones to really sing). If you are
using a $200-$300 pair of headphones though, you probably already know
about the need for a good amp/DAC combo, so that’s that.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I love my K702s. Interestingly, I have gotten used to a much louder
volume with this pair of headphones than with my 600Ms. Let me explain.
I usually listen to music on medium/low, but I can now listen to loud
pop songs on high volume without any discomfort. I think it has
something to do with the bigger sound stage (open back design, plus the
way the speakers are physically further away from my eardrums).</p>
<p>My 600Ms don’t sound as clean and awesome as they used to; for one, they
have too much bass and the sound feels very muddied, as if the sound is
coming from another room with the door closed. I had no idea that a
simple headphone upgrade could change my attitude to computer audio so
much. Unfortunately, as much as I loved the 600Ms when I first got them,
I can’t really stand them now…</p>
<p>I strongly recommend these headphones, or another similarly-priced model
(the Beyerdynamic DT-770 is a longtime competitor) to anyone who has
never invested more than $50 on a pair of headphones. You will
definitely hear the difference, given a decent amp/DAC.</p>
