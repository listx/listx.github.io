<p>TL;DR: Check out my <a href="https://github.com/listx/git/blob/study/STUDY_NOTES.md">STUDY_NOTES.md</a> on Git if you want a quick understanding of (ancient) Git internals!</p>
<p>I’ve been using Git since 2009. In all that time I never really bothered with
understanding Git internals, because frankly after learning what a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) was, everything just fell into place.</p>
<p>That’s going to change, because in the coming weeks, I will start contributing
to Git on a somewhat regular basis (at least, that’s the plan). It won’t be the
first time contributing to the project (which I did back in <a href="2014-09-09-my-first-contribution-to-git.html">2014</a>), but I will
need to begin studying how Git works under the hood.</p>
<p>To that end, I spent the better part of last weekend trying to understand Git’s
internals. The current Git codebase is a bit daunting, and there’s no way that
I’m going to read it all any time soon. But the very first commit of Git <em>is</em>
small enough to read in one sitting, and so I tried compiling it (there were
lots of errors), while taking notes in the source code directly. I also actually
used the produced binaries to prove to myself that yes, this system actually
does work even at this primitive stage.</p>
<p>Now, there <strong>are</strong> major differences between this ancient root-commit version of
“Git” and modern Git. However, I’ve taken note of all such differences (at least
as many as I could gather, within reason) by digging into the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">Git mailing list archive</a> to try to make sense of why things were changed the way they were (e.g.,
How come we have so-called “pack” files? How come the SHA1 hash of an object
(using <code class="verbatim">sha1sum</code>) is not the same as its directory name plus filename?) You can
see my notes in the <a href="https://github.com/listx/git/blob/study/STUDY_NOTES.md">STUDY_NOTES.md</a> file for the answers.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I found Linus Torvalds’ initial design decisions to be
impressively elegant. Reading the first commit made me have multiple “ah-ha!”
moments behind why Git has a distinction between the index and the working tree,
why it doesn’t track empty directories, why Git doesn’t care if you blow away
the working tree as long as the <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder is intact, etc. And the code is
pretty easy to follow! It’s a great resource for any aspiring C hacker.</p>
<p>Note: I’ve reproduced the study notes below for posterity. Do check out <a href="https://github.com/listx/git/tree/study">the branch directly</a>, or apply <a href="https://github.com/listx/listx_blog/tree/master/file/git-archaeology">the patches</a> yourself on the root commit.</p>
<h1 id="root-commit-git-study-notes">Root-commit Git study notes</h1>
<p>This is a special branch of Git for learning purposes. It is special
because it is based off the absolute minimal “ancient” implementation of
Git (Linus Torvald’s root commit at
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290"><code class="verbatim">e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290</code></a>),
with some small changes to make it easy to compile with
<a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">Nix</a> (see the Makefile changes) and
also “feel” more like modern Git (namely, the use of <code class="verbatim">.git/</code> instead of
<code class="verbatim">.dircache/</code>). Yes, you can technically grab the
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/6ad6d3d36c5924c8ff502ebbb6a6216df01e7efb">100th or so commit</a> which basically has all of the changes I made, but you’d
be dealing with a lot more code to read. If you just want to quickly
understand Git’s data structures, there’s honestly nothing faster than
reading the root commit (it’s only ~1000 lines of C, including comments)
and with some additional notes to fill in any missing gaps (which this
document tries to do).</p>
<p>The biggest revelation I had while creating these notes is that Git’s
data structures have proven to be incredibly stable — the initial idea
of an object database (<code class="verbatim">.git/objects/...</code>) and the cache (<code class="verbatim">.git/index</code>)
were there from day 1 and are still the main workhorses for Git. Knowing
these two concepts will radically reduce the perceived complexity of
modern Git’s numerous bells and whistles, as every other thing you see
in the <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder are mere extensions of these two essential data
structures.</p>
<p>This version comes with a basic Usage Guide to help users actually use
the binaries that shipped with the root commit. Run <code class="verbatim">make</code> (you need the
<a href="https://nixos.org/download.html">Nix package manager</a>) and try to use
the commands in the order described in the Usage Guide below. After (or
perhaps before?) you run each command, read its source code. You might
want to have a look at <code class="verbatim">cache.h</code> first — but the main “meat” of it all
is in <code class="verbatim">update-cache.c</code> — which makes sense, because the cache is
always updated first before anything is written to the object database.</p>
<p>Pro tip: use
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/6ad6d3d36c5924c8ff502ebbb6a6216df01e7efb"><code class="verbatim">6ad6d3d36c5924c8ff502ebbb6a6216df01e7efb</code></a>
as a shortcut to view the first 100ish commits in Git’s history. This is
handy to understand some of the early changes that went into Git. As a
bonus, this commit also updates the README to capture the workflow of
actually using GIT in its ancient form. Perhaps it is obvious, but use
<code class="verbatim">git log -p README</code> to see its history.</p>
<h1 id="data-structures">Data structures</h1>
<p>The two big data structures are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The object database (all files under <code class="verbatim">.git/objects/...</code>), and</li>
<li>The index file (aka “cache”, at <code class="verbatim">.git/index</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Refer to README for a more thorough discussion of these data structures.
But here are a few more interesting notes about each data structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-object-database">The Object Database</h2>
<h3 id="the-8-bit-fanout">The 8-bit fanout</h3>
<p>The object database has 256 folders, named <code class="verbatim">00</code> through <code class="verbatim">ff</code> in hex
notation (the first 8 bits of the 20-byte SHA1 hashing scheme used to
generate the object IDs for this database). You may wonder why do we
bother with this structure (after all, all files are already named with
their unique SHA1 hash so the chance of an innocent collision is
virtually zero). Torvalds stated in
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504220844390.2344@ppc970.osdl.org/">April 2005</a> that he didn’t want hundreds of thousands of files in one
subdirectory:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>The 8-bit initial fan-out is very much a
middle ground: we waste some space (and some time) doing it, but it does
make the really horrible case largely go away.
</code></pre>
<p>The “horrible case” probably refers to the possibility of hundreds of
thousands of files all residing in a single directory, which Torvalds
brought up in the linked email.</p>
<h3 id="object-ids">Object IDs</h3>
<p>You can run <code class="verbatim">sha1sum</code> of any file in the object database and the output
(SHA1 hash) will match the filename path. E.g.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" data-org-language="sh"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sha1sum .git/objects/cc/41b0dfbe81a71ca922cda3c9de9db3a25a56b4</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">cc41b0dfbe81a71ca922cda3c9de9db3a25a56b4</span>  .git/objects/cc/41b0dfbe81a71ca922cda3c9de9db3a25a56b4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and notice that <code class="verbatim">cc41b0dfbe81a71ca922cda3c9de9db3a25a56b4</code> matches the
<code class="verbatim">cc/41b0dfbe81a71ca922cda3c9de9db3a25a56b4</code>. However, this is no longer
the case and you’ll get a different SHA1 hash using any recent Git
version. The reason is because Git originally hashed the compressed
(post-zlibbed) contents, but now it hashes the decompressed
(pre-zlibbed) content. This switch-over was done in
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/d98b46f8d9a3daf965a39f8c0089c1401e0081ee"><code class="verbatim">d98b46f8d9a3daf965a39f8c0089c1401e0081ee</code></a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/f18ca7316631914776136455c151d70318299459"><code class="verbatim">f18ca7316631914776136455c151d70318299459</code></a>,
just a couple weeks after the root commit, mainly for performance
reasons (because <code class="verbatim">write-tree</code> was taking too long in applying patches).
See
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504192337120.6467@ppc970.osdl.org/">the original discussion</a> and the
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504200144260.6467@ppc970.osdl.org/">“Object DB conversion” announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Also see
<a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/reading_git_objects.html">this page</a> for a guide on using Python to check the hashes of objects (in
case you want to check the hash output independently of Git tooling).</p>
<h3 id="only-basic-compression">Only basic compression</h3>
<p>Modern Git uses at least two additional schemes not present in this
initial version to help reduce redundant data: pack files (record deltas
of similar objects), and recursive tree objects (that’s right, in the
original implementation, a tree object could only refer to blobs).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pack files</p>
<p>Note that in this version, Git treats a file’s content as an atomic unit
of data — it doesn’t perform any form of “chunking” to divide it up
into smaller bits (similar to what bittorrent does). So every file will
get its own blob, and the only way that a blob will be reused (thus
saving disk space) in a subsequent commit is if does not change. It must
match identically!</p>
<p>You may think, “why not just divide a file into chunks, and make blobs
out of each chunk?” — that way, you’d naturally get some level of
deduping, even without any additional work. Torvalds <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504151117360.7211@ppc970.osdl.org/">considered this but rejected the idea for two reasons: performance and simplicity</a>.</p>
<p>Just a couple months after the above email though, Git
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/c323ac7d9c573c5ee8b45b9b9def92a4d4d8204d">learned about pack files</a>. Basically, pack files compress a range of reachable
objects between two commits and puts them all into two files, a pack
index (<code class="verbatim">.idx</code>) and pack (<code class="verbatim">.pack</code>) file. The basic idea is that you can
put all of these objects together in the <code class="verbatim">.pack</code> file, allowing you to
do some level of compression inside it (assuming you have lots of
objects that have similar content). Here is a description of how it
would work in
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0506260905200.19755@ppc970.osdl.org/">Torvald’s own words</a>. Here’s a somewhat retrospective
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0506271755140.19755@ppc970.osdl.org/">announcement</a>,
which explains that the previous “delta object” approach (where Git
stored delta objects in the object database) is deprecated (however, do
note that the algorithms to find the deltas (<code class="verbatim">diff_delta()</code>) was re-used
in the pack files, so not everything was discarded).</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why the pack files have a separate dedicated index
file, it basically comes down to
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0506261206170.19755@ppc970.osdl.org/">performance and simplicity, again</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Recursive tree objects</p>
<p>As trees can currently only refer to blobs only, this means that every
commit is somewhat wasteful (although this has the unique property that
a single commit refers to a single tree object that has everything in
it).</p>
<p>Recursive tree objects were added in
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/d6d3f9d0125a7215f3cdc2600b2307ca55b69536"><code class="verbatim">d6d3f9d0125a7215f3cdc2600b2307ca55b69536</code></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-cache">The Cache</h2>
<p>The cache, or index file, represents a tree “snapshot”. It is what is
staged, ready to be committed. More precisely, it is just a
<code class="verbatim">cache_header</code> followed by a list of <code class="verbatim">cache_entry</code> values, where each
<code class="verbatim">cache_entry</code> is a <code class="verbatim">blob</code> object’s metadata. Among other things, the
<code class="verbatim">cache_header</code> records how many cache entries there are in the index
file. This is still true in modern Git as of March 2023 — if you run
<code class="verbatim">hexdump -C .git/index | head -n1</code> you can see, for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" data-org-language="sh"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> hexdump <span class="at">-C</span> .git/index <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">head</span> <span class="at">-n1</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">00000000</span>  44 49 52 43 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 0d 64 15 77 69  <span class="kw">|</span><span class="ex">DIRC........d.wi</span><span class="kw">|</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code class="verbatim">DIRC</code> is a magic number (standing for <code class="verbatim">dircache</code>, the
original name of the <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder) followed by 4 bytes (unsigned int)
for the index version and another 4 bytes showing the number of cache
entries, or file paths, that are being “tracked” for purposes of tree
object creation. In the example above the index version is <code class="verbatim">1</code> (modern
Git uses version <code class="verbatim">2</code>), and there are <code class="verbatim">0x0d</code> or <code class="verbatim">13</code> cache entries, or
files, that would make up the current tree.</p>
<p>Note that if you run the above on an index file created by the original
<code class="verbatim">update-cache</code>, you would see instead something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" data-org-language="sh"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> hexdump <span class="at">-C</span> .git/index <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">head</span> <span class="at">-n1</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">00000000</span>  43 52 49 44 01 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 2b 1a 2d 28  <span class="kw">|</span><span class="ex">CRID........+.-</span><span class="er">(</span><span class="kw">|</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>because the byte order was using little-endian, “host byte order”. This
is what is meant by “native CPU byte format” comment in <code class="verbatim">cache.h</code>
(because most CPUs are Intel, and Intel uses little-endian). The byte
order was changed in
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/ccc4feb579265266d0a4a73c0c9443ecc0c26ce3"><code class="verbatim">ccc4feb579265266d0a4a73c0c9443ecc0c26ce3</code></a>
to use big-endian, also called “network byte order”, for convenience
over NFS.</p>
<h2 id="other-missing-things-vs-modern-git">Other missing things vs modern Git</h2>
<p>This initial version of Git does not have support for <code class="verbatim">HEAD</code>
(<code class="verbatim">.git/HEAD</code>) or branches (<code class="verbatim">.git/refs/heads/...</code>). In fact there are no
human-friendly references at all! But one can easily understand that
references are just pointers to the object store — all you would need
is a way to keep track of the latest commit by saving its object ID
(SHA1 hash) somewhere. The simplest possible thing you could do is to
have a file with this object ID in it — and this is what modern Git
(still) does. The old
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/6ad6d3d36c5924c8ff502ebbb6a6216df01e7efb">README</a>
notes that in practice, the SHA1 hash was written at <code class="verbatim">.git/HEAD</code>. It was
formally recognized as such just a day later in
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/839a7a06f35bf8cd563a41d6db97f453ab108129"><code class="verbatim">839a7a06f35bf8cd563a41d6db97f453ab108129</code></a>, as part of the <code class="verbatim">git-prune-script</code>
and <code class="verbatim">git-pull-script</code> helpers to help with merging.</p>
<h2 id="usage-guide">Usage Guide</h2>
<p>This guide explains how the earliest version of Git (root commit) works.
You can read these steps and also look up the C source code and read
them to get a better sense of how everything works.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Initialize the object database with <code class="verbatim">init-db</code>. This is the <code class="verbatim">.git</code>
directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Make changes to files. These files can be any file except the <code class="verbatim">.git</code>
directory. We don’t have the concept of <code class="verbatim">.gitignore</code> yet, and also,
all dotfiles (any file that begins with a <code class="verbatim">.</code>) are ignored and cannot
be tracked by Git.</p></li>
<li><p>Stage modified files with <code class="verbatim">update-cache &lt;FILE&gt; [...FILES]</code>. This
compresses these files’ contents and saves them to the object
database, such that each file gets its own object database file. At
this point the files are tracked by Git. It also results in adding
this file’s metadata (essentially the filename and SHA1 of its
contents) to the <code class="verbatim">.git/index</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Check the diff of what is in the <code class="verbatim">.git/index</code> (staged)
versus the current working tree with <code class="verbatim">show-diff</code>. We are just diffing
whatever is in the current cache <code class="verbatim">.git/index</code> (essentially the last
known “tree-to-be-written-to-object-database-but-not-yet”) and what
is on disk at those paths that the cache describes. The diffing
comparison is basic and is based on timestamps and inodes (presumably
for performance).</p>
<p>This diff is the ancient equivalent of <code class="verbatim">git diff</code>. If we add those
files that have been modified with <code class="verbatim">update-cache</code>, then <code class="verbatim">show-diff</code>
will show nothing, because the working tree files on disk match what
is in the index file (just like how modern <code class="verbatim">git diff</code> will show
nothing, unless you invoke <code class="verbatim">git diff --cached</code>, in this situation).</p>
<p>Note also that we are not comparing things to a previous commit of
any kind. Instead we are always only diffing the files that were
touched/modified (during the course of normal development) and what
the index file has. It’s even more primitive than the modern
“detached HEAD mode” in Git because we do not automatically diff
against a “current commit” because the concept of a “current commit”
doesn’t exist yet — we literally have blobs, trees, and commits in
the object database, the index file (describing whatever paths make
up another (perhaps new and unique) tree object), and the working
tree (everything except the <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder).</p>
<p>Lastly, the <code class="verbatim">show-diff</code> command shells out to <code class="verbatim">diff</code> (so the codebase
doesn’t have any fancy diffing algorithms).</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code class="verbatim">write-tree</code> to save the data in <code class="verbatim">.git/index</code> is its own tree
object in the object database. The SHA1 of this tree object is
printed to STDOUT. Take a note of this SHA1 hash, as it will be
referenced to construct a commit (changeset) object.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Check the SHA1 from <code class="verbatim">write-tree</code> with <code class="verbatim">read-tree &lt;SHA1&gt;</code>.
This will display the tree object (by displaying its blobs).</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new commit with
<code class="verbatim">echo "my-commit-message" | commit-tree &lt;SHA1&gt;</code>, using the SHA1 from
step 5 above. This will create a new commit object and write it to
the object database.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Check the commit with <code class="verbatim">cat-file &lt;COMMIT_SHA1&gt;</code>. This will
write the commit message and metadata (including the tree SHA (and
parent commit SHAs for non-root commits)) to a temporary file. You
can just <code class="verbatim">cat</code> out this file to see it (commit date, author name,
email, etc.).</p>
<p>The fact that <code class="verbatim">cat-file</code> writes to disk is a bit annoying, and so it
learned to output to STDOUT in
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/bf0c6e839c692142784caf07b523cd69442e57a5"><code class="verbatim">bf0c6e839c692142784caf07b523cd69442e57a5</code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2-7 above, but for step 5 pass in the <code class="verbatim">-p &lt;SHA1&gt;</code> flag
to mark it as a child of a previous commit SHA. You can pass in
multiple <code class="verbatim">-p</code> flags to denote multiple parents (e.g., a merge). For
the very first merge in Git’s own history, see
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/b51ad4314078298194d23d46e2b4473ffd32a88a"><code class="verbatim">b51ad4314078298194d23d46e2b4473ffd32a88a</code></a>.</p></li>
