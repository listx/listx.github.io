<p>TL;DR: Check out my <a href="https://github.com/listx/git/blob/study/STUDY_NOTES.md">STUDY_NOTES.md</a> on Git if you want a quick understanding of (ancient) Git internals!</p>
<p>I’ve been using Git since 2009. In all that time I never really bothered with
understanding Git internals, because frankly after learning what a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) was, everything just fell into place.</p>
<p>That’s going to change, because in the coming weeks, I will start contributing
to Git on a somewhat regular basis (at least, that’s the plan). It won’t be the
first time contributing to the project (which I did back in <a href="2014-09-09-my-first-contribution-to-git.html">2014</a>), but I will
need to begin studying how Git works under the hood.</p>
<p>To that end, I spent the better part of last weekend trying to understand Git’s
internals. The current Git codebase is a bit daunting, and there’s no way that
I’m going to read it all any time soon. But the very first commit of Git <em>is</em>
small enough to read in one sitting, and so I tried compiling it (there were
lots of errors), while taking notes in the source code directly. I also actually
used the produced binaries to prove to myself that yes, this system actually
does work even at this primitive stage.</p>
<p>Now, there <strong>are</strong> major differences between this ancient root-commit version of
“Git” and modern Git. However, I’ve taken note of all such differences (at least
as many as I could gather, within reason) by digging into the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/">Git mailing list archive</a> to try to make sense of why things were changed the way they were (e.g.,
How come we have so-called “pack” files? How come the SHA1 hash of an object
(using <code class="verbatim">sha1sum</code>) is not the same as its directory name plus filename?) You can
see my notes in the <a href="https://github.com/listx/git/blob/study/STUDY_NOTES.md">STUDY_NOTES.md</a> file for the answers.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I found Linus Torvalds’ initial design decisions to be
impressively elegant. Reading the first commit made me have multiple “ah-ha!”
moments behind why Git has a distinction between the index and the working tree,
why it doesn’t track empty directories, why Git doesn’t care if you blow away
the working tree as long as the <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder is intact, etc. And the code is
pretty easy to follow! It’s a great resource for any aspiring C hacker.</p>
