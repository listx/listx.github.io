<p>I love computer programming so much that I consider it a life skill such
as swimming or riding a bicycle. The main reason why I wanted to get
into programming when I was a kid was because it was the first step to
becoming a game developer. I did not turn out to be a game developer
(yet?), but I don’t regret at all the many hours I’ve spent in front of
the computer screen hacking away at my pet projects. Now that I’ve spent
some years at this hobby, I now realize how lucky I am to have the
amount of knowledge about computers and programming languages.</p>
<p>If you are able to read this post, you are very lucky, because it means
that you are able to read English. English is the primary script used to
write most programming languages today. And many quality books on
programming and computer science are written natively in English.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Programming is the art of telling computers <em>exactly</em> what to do. But
the complexity of the code you write is, by definition, only as complex
as you can comprehend it enough to write it in the first place. That is,
programming is akin to laying down a sequence of thoughts in your head,
and then translating it to a language that the machine can understand.
In other words, programming is the art of <em>creating copies of yourself</em>
to perform some arbitrary mental task. Isn’t that cool?</p>
<h1 id="reasons-why-you-should-learn-to-program">Reasons Why You Should Learn to Program</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is entirely a mental effort. All you have to do is <em>think</em>.</li>
<li>Because it only involves thinking (and some typing), you can do it
well into your later years past retirement age. Few hobbies can be
actively practiced like this.</li>
<li>You only need a computer and an internet connection to learn
programming, or to find resources later on to help you write the code
you need.</li>
<li>Programming is good for your brain because you have to brainstorm and
concentrate to get anything done.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="things-to-help-your-journey">Things to Help Your Journey</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNIX environment</strong>. E.g., any modern, popular Linux distribution. Why?
Because you get a <em>truckload</em> of state-of-the-art programming tools
for <em>free</em> with zero-effort installs. Some keywords for you here are:
ruby, python, perl, gcc, gdb, clang, valgrind, ghci, vim, and emacs.</li>
<li><strong>Text editor</strong>. Vim and Emacs are both good choices; I suggest learning
both. I have my configuration set up so that Emacs behaves almost
exactly like Vim, because Vim was my first foray into serious text
editing.</li>
</ul>
