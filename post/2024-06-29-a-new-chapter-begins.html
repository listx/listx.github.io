<h1 id="jobs">Jobs</h1>
<p>I recently started work at Qantas, focusing on backend systems written in
Clojure. It’s an interesting change from the Golang work I did at Google for the
Kubernetes community (primarily on <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow">Prow</a>, the Kubernetes-native CI system). I
expect to learn lots of new things and continue to grow as an engineer.</p>
<p>The opportunity at Qantas presents a unique proposition to me because I’ve
somehow managed to avoid getting familiar with Java and the JVM so far in my
career. I’ve been doing some Clojure exercises on <a href="https://exercism.org/profiles/listx">Exercism</a> for a few weeks now
and am getting the hang of the language. And I’ve been liking it so far — it
feels like Haskell without all of the mind-bending GHC extensions, plus a great
library/ecosystem story (seamless JVM interop). Oh and I actually prefer Lisp
syntax over Haskell syntax (I’ll choose Lisp macros over Template Haskell, every
time).</p>
<h1 id="blog">Blog</h1>
<p>I have some other blog post items in the backlog, so I plan on getting around to
them in due time. I’ve just cleaned out some of the bitrot that’s been plaguing
this site’s codebase for a while, so things are in working order again.</p>
<h1 id="git">Git</h1>
<p>I must mention that a few months back the Git community interviewed me for their
<a href="https://git.github.io/rev_news/2024/03/31/edition-109/#developer-spotlight-linus-arver">Developer Spotlight</a>! Sadly I haven’t been involved much with Git as of late (due
to moving countries, and also battling a nasty cold), but I do hope to upstream
the 50+ patches I still have locally for improving the parser for the
<code class="verbatim">git-interpret-trailers</code> subcommand. You could say that those patches helped me
understand how to work with the Git mailing list (as well as getting used to
writing C again).</p>
<p>I also started using Notmuch again inside Emacs to communicate with the mailing
list. I should write a short post about it.</p>
<h1 id="australia">Australia</h1>
<p>I’m now in Australia! How exciting! I fell in love with the country when I first
visited it in 2019, and now I feel very lucky to call Australia home. I’m slowly
getting used to the accent, and I do wonder if I’ll ever pick it up myself.</p>
<p>The weather has been a bit wild (we had a cold snap with sub-zero temperatures
in the first couple weeks of winter), but I really can’t complain because it’s
still quite nice compared to Seattle’s cold and wet climate.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
