<h1 id="the-zq-keyoard-layout">The ZQ Keyoard Layout</h1>
<p>I’ve spent quite some time on keyboards in my previous posts, and this post is no different.
After several months of tweaking my <a href="./2016-04-14-esrille-nisse-keyboard.html">original layout</a>, I have more or less settled on the final design.
You can get the sources at my repo <a href="https://github.com/listx/new-keyboard">here</a>.</p>
<p>Is for the name “ZQ”, it was originally chosen from the way these keys were arranged; the location of these keys have since changed, but the name has stuck.</p>

<h2 id="keycap-arrangement">Keycap Arrangement</h2>
<p>I have not covered this topic before, but I think it is worth mentioning.
On the underside of each keycap, there is a number; presumably for the row that the keycap is designed for.
I’ve rearranged the default keycap placement to better reflect how I use my keys.
The biggest change from the default Esrille setup is that I vertically flip the thumb row keys, so that they are “upside-down”.
I find this arrangement more comfortable for my thumbs.</p>
<pre><code>    n n n n n n     n n n n n n
    n n n n n         n n n n n
n 3 3 3 3 3 3 n     n 3 3 3 3 3 3 n
3 3 2 2 2 2 2 n     n 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 &lt;--- Home row
  1 2 1 1 1 2         2 1 1 1 2 1
      1 1 1 1 1     1 1 1 1 1 &lt;--------- Thumb row*

Legend

n) No number
1) Row 1
2) Row 2
3) Row 3

*The thumb row keycaps are flipped upside-down for better comfort.

<h1 id="typing-speed">Typing Speed</h1>
<p>After some time, I realized that the end goal was to design a layout that was not more “optimal” in the sense of mechanical efficiency, but rather to design something more <em>comfortable</em> to use.
I can readily say that even at this early stage, I tend to like this layout more over Qwerty because my hands stay put as I type.
The only time I move my wrists from their default position is when I need to reach the six keys up top in the base layer (<code class="verbatim">!#*/~$</code>).</p>
<p>It may turn out that this new layout does not really improve raw typing speed; but really I don’t care because home-row access to parentheses and the backspace key are too good to let go.</p>
<h1 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h1>
<p>The design has changed quite a bit in these past few months.
After some initial trials, I realized that the arrangement recommended by my <a href="https://github.com/listx/keylo">program</a> was not really optimized the way I wanted it to be.
For one, the corpus I fed into the program was not very good because it didn’t realy reflect my real-world use-case; I use Vim-style HJKL keys almost everywhere, and really to get a truly representative histogram of keypresses, I should have used a keylogger for some months to record my actual usage.
As time was of the essence, I decided to just evolve the layout gradually, tweaking bits I found annoying.</p>
<p>One hurdle was simply trying to avoid using the same finger in succession.
In the current ZQ layout, the right index finger is charged with six keys: MHBFJD.
It took a lot of trial and error to arrive at this combination.</p>
<p>I also just kept the original Qwerty placement of the HJKL keys.
The main reason is that I use these keys all the time, so much that they deserve their original home-row placement.
And, actually they helped in reducing same-finger consecutiveness (J and K are rare letters in English).</p>
<p>Another point of concern was the interaction of some key combinations like YN and &lt;Return&gt;.
It is common to type either Y or N and press &lt;Return&gt; immediately after, when dealing with interactive torminal programs.
The same goes for some UNIX-y combinations like <code class="verbatim">~/</code> for the home directory in the filesystem, or <code class="verbatim">*</code> and <code class="verbatim">/</code> for interactive search in vim(1) and less(1), respectvely.
The current design of ZQ strives to make these combinations easy to type.</p>
<p>Lastly, I paid a great deal of attention for certain common letter combinations — in particular, “gh”, “ch”, “sh”, “th”, and “wh”.
Because I decided to keep HJKL keys on the home row, and because H was assigned to the right index finger, I had to make sure that I place the GCSTW keys either on the left side of the keyboard (as I did with “W”), or place them for the other fingers.
This effort alone resulted in dictating where most of the keys ended up.</p>
<p>After all that’s been said, time will tell if I truly do end up using this layout.
I have a friend who uses Dvorak for work and Qwerty for gaming; perhaps I’ll end up in a similar boat.</p>
